# Changelog

All notable changes to BrowserSkill will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

Starting from 0.2.0, CLI / Extension / DSH Plugin share the same version number.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Extension: input to a background Agent Window tab no longer keeps failing with
  `input_not_ready` after Chrome drops the session's focus override without a detach
  ([#355](https://github.com/Tencent/BrowserSkill/issues/355)). The session's
  background-execution lease resends the override and waits for a rendered frame; the
  input is sent only once the page reports `visible`, and otherwise still fails before
  dispatch.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- DSH Plugin: support DSH `0.2` hosts while retaining compatibility with the
  `0.1.5-rc.3` SDK.
- Extension: simplify browser profile controls and explain why profile
  instructions are unavailable when they cannot be copied.
- Daemons started with `--foreground` no longer install updates or replace
  themselves with a detached process. `bsk update` leaves them running
  (`"daemon": "left_to_host"` in JSON output); restart them in their owning
  terminal or supervisor after updating.
- A daemon that cannot write next to its executable reports new releases
  instead of installing them. Update attempts, stages and errors are recorded
  in `update-state.json` and shown by `bsk doctor`. Windows `bsk update --json`
  now reports `"status": "updated"` instead of `"staged"`.
- Installation and skill guidance document `BSK_AUTO_UPDATE=off`, daemon
  startup in WorkBuddy and CodeBuddy, and shared-login checks for parallel tasks.
- English and Chinese privacy policies clarify screenshot exports through
  `downloads`, human-help notifications, and retention of exported files.

### Fixed

- CLI/Daemon: make updates recoverable across platforms
  ([#336](https://github.com/Tencent/BrowserSkill/issues/336)). Auto-update
  verifies the new executable and waits for its daemon to serve the same port
  before the old daemon exits. If takeover fails or exceeds 20 seconds, the
  previous executable and service are restored; auto-update retries after 6 hours.
  Windows replaces the running executable without a detached update script.
- `bsk update` verifies the replacement before stopping a background daemon,
  restores the previous version if restart fails, and preserves the actual
  serving port, including daemons started with `--port 0`. If the host cannot
  restart the daemon, it is left running (`"daemon": "left_running"`).
- Serialize updates to the same executable across bsk homes; retain the
  executable path after rollback on Linux; and recover safely if a daemon
  stops during auto-update.
- Daemon: settle pending calls immediately when an extension connection closes
  or is replaced, preserving unknown-outcome errors for inputs, transfers and
  tab borrows. `bsk doctor` and `bsk browsers` report connected extensions that
  have stopped sending heartbeats; closed connections report a disconnect.
- Protocol: preserve explicit `null` results without silently turning invalid
  responses into null results, and reject conflicting result/error fields and
  null error fields.
- Downloads: capture attachments opened through `target="_blank"` and attribute
  them to the clicked tab. Correlate downloads with click dispatch, preserve
  effects that already occurred when a trigger fails, and stop cancelled or
  expired triggers from dispatching later input or leaving overlays behind.
- Browser input: dispatch every press in DOM multi-click actions, honor
  persistent background execution leases, and keep emulation overrides scoped
  to their session and debugger attachment.
- Recording: finish recordings after navigation to blob or restricted pages
  that cannot host the overlay, and clear stale CLI recording state only for
  the session that owns it.
- Human help: bound URL regular-expression work and prevent overlapping
  completion polling so checks cannot block the extension worker.
- Extension overlays: ignore stale state from earlier generations and worker
  instances.
- Website debugging: redact HTML-encoded sensitive input attributes before
  retaining evidence.
- DSH Plugin: reconnect failed observation streams, show outages in the
  observation view and collapsed capsule, and allow new browser sessions after
  an ancestor session is archived.
- `bsk doctor` compares installed skills against the CLI's bundled version;
  skill entry points also fit their size budget on CRLF checkouts.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- [Task-scoped website debugging](docs/website-debugging.md): bounded request/body
  capture, operation-linked console and page context, browser-local history and JSON export,
  CLI and DSH entry points, and an extension evidence workspace. Existing popup
  controls are preserved, with an additive current-task card.
- Debug operation cards now include manual inputs, field-change chains, delayed
  evidence, source-aware noise filtering and explicit capture gaps.
- Website debugging: task-scoped HTTP rules and request replay, native performance
  metrics, request aggregation and duplicate-request analysis.
- Remote gateway task previews and attribution of agent-opened popups and tabs
  to the task that opened them.
- Browser instance naming in the extension popup and explicit
  [browser profile selection](docs/browser-profiles.md) across CLI, DSH and skill guidance.
- Seven additional interface languages: Traditional Chinese, Japanese, French,
  Italian, Spanish, German and Brazilian Portuguese.
- CLI and DSH skill reference bundles with resource-path validation, safe upgrades
  and migration of existing managed installations.

### Changed

- Extension privacy policies now describe website debugging data, browser-local
  history retention and deletion, requested sharing, and redaction limits.
- DSH Plugin: align SDK dependencies with `0.1.5-rc.3`, Cordis `4.0.2` and
  Schemastery `3.18.2`.
- Reduce repeated observation work by reusing sibling context for repeated action labels.
- Skill guidance clarifies installation prerequisites, browser readiness, profile
  selection and the treatment of page content as untrusted data.

### Fixed

- Recoverable browser session startup and stop handling, including pending cleanup
  and protection of shared daemons after launcher timeouts.
- Windows daemon startup isolation from caller job objects.
- Background navigation and viewport/full-page screenshots without activating
  controlled tabs; full-page capture at fractional DPI and with overlay scrollbars.
- Bounded renderer and frame reads, preserving usable observations when optional
  layout reads time out and preventing overlapping reads after a timeout.
- Keep page actions visible beside nonmodal sidebars and honor accessibility modality.
- Prevent control overlays from swallowing clicks and clear stale overlays when
  observed tabs are released.
- Accept lowercase special keys, match ARIA loading states case-insensitively,
  return visible option labels from selection, and retain same-URL reloads in recordings.
- Deliver navigation timeout results before transport expiry and bound human-help cleanup.
- Enforce remote device capacity across pending connections and preserve active
  sessions while renaming browser instances.
- DSH Plugin: settle commands when child processes exit without closing their
  streams, bound cancellation and output draining, and preserve completed results.
- DSH Plugin: restore lazy tool registration after plugin reloads and resumed
  conversations without repeatedly scanning streaming history.
- DSH Plugin: render screenshot cards independently of host attachment UI components,
  preserve previews across host rerenders, and keep extreme-aspect-ratio thumbnails usable.
- Preserve managed skill source links and handle CRLF metadata and incomplete installations.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- [Remote browser connections](docs/remote-extension-connection.md) with a built-in
  server, one-use pairing links, device credential renewal and revocation, and
  support for native TLS or a TLS reverse proxy. Remote upload and download are unsupported.
- [Operation audit](docs/operation-audit.md): opt-in task history stored on the
  daemon host, with redacted operation metadata, export, deletion and 30-day retention
- [Full-page screenshots](docs/long-screenshot.md) from extension Quick Actions and
  the CLI, with streamed PNG output, cancellation and lazy-loaded page capture
- Canvas visual refs, on-demand element screenshots and screenshot-bound point
  clicks; observation cursor continuation when an explicit token limit is used
- [Scroll-to element primitive](docs/scroll-to.md) across CLI, Extension and DSH Plugin,
  with ancestor-clipped visible bounds, iframe support and cooperative cancellation
- Native [mouse-wheel input](docs/wheel.md), explicit focus and blur actions
- [Host-managed daemon setup](docs/sandboxed-agents.md) with `BSK_HOME` and
  `BSK_AUTO_START=0` for agents whose command sandboxes reap background processes
- Configurable local connection port in the extension popup and Korean localization

### Changed

- **Automation settings:** the extension's saved borrow-confirmation and human-help
  switches govern existing and new sessions. `--unattended`, `tab borrow --no-confirm`
  and `BSK_REQUEST_HELP=off` are deprecated compatibility inputs and cannot override
  these switches. Set the browser preferences when upgrading unattended workflows.
- Managed CLI skills update only while their content matches the installed baseline;
  custom instructions and local edits are preserved, with recovery guidance in `doctor`
- DSH Plugin: use the native browser sidebar when available, with a floating-panel fallback

### Fixed

- Windows installer path handling, verification of the resolved executable, and
  replacement of installations using a daemon from another directory
- Browser connection preference recovery and compatibility during staggered component upgrades
- Observation document and frame geometry consistency, Canvas target identity checks,
  and screenshot/session cleanup during cancellation or navigation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-09

- CLI / DSH Plugin: cancellation propagation and upload/download cleanup when the parent process exits
- Extension: tab ownership and session cleanup when agent tabs fail to open or borrowed tabs are returned or closed
- Extension: navigation recovery when other extensions restrict Chrome DevTools Protocol access
- Extension: background input filling, automatic append behavior, and verification of field values before reporting success
- Extension: match observed form state to the correct element after page changes
- Extension: UUID generation fallback for recording and overlays on insecure origins
- Browser locale matching for regional language variants
- DSH Plugin: observation state synchronization, thumbnail capture lifecycle, and stale preview cleanup
- DSH Plugin: removed the obsolete client runtime host dependency
