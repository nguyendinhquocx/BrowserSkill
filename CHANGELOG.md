# Changelog

All notable changes to BrowserSkill will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

Starting from 0.2.0, CLI / Extension / DSH Plugin share the same version number.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- [Task-scoped website debugging](docs/website-debugging.md): bounded request/body
  capture, operation-linked console and page context, browser-local history and JSON export,
  CLI and DSH entry points, and an extension evidence workspace. Existing popup
  controls are preserved, with an additive current-task card.
- Debug operation cards now include manual inputs, field-change chains, delayed
  evidence, source-aware noise filtering and explicit capture gaps.
- Website debugging: task-scoped HTTP rules and request replay, native performance
  metrics, request aggregation and duplicate-request analysis.
- Remote gateway task previews and attribution of agent-opened popups and tabs
  to the task that opened them.
- Browser instance naming in the extension popup and explicit
  [browser profile selection](docs/browser-profiles.md) across CLI, DSH and skill guidance.
- Seven additional interface languages: Traditional Chinese, Japanese, French,
  Italian, Spanish, German and Brazilian Portuguese.
- CLI and DSH skill reference bundles with resource-path validation, safe upgrades
  and migration of existing managed installations.

### Changed

- Extension privacy policies now describe website debugging data, browser-local
  history retention and deletion, requested sharing, and redaction limits.
- DSH Plugin: align SDK dependencies with `0.1.5-rc.3`, Cordis `4.0.2` and
  Schemastery `3.18.2`.
- Reduce repeated observation work by reusing sibling context for repeated action labels.
- Skill guidance clarifies installation prerequisites, browser readiness, profile
  selection and the treatment of page content as untrusted data.

### Fixed

- Recoverable browser session startup and stop handling, including pending cleanup
  and protection of shared daemons after launcher timeouts.
- Windows daemon startup isolation from caller job objects.
- Background navigation and viewport/full-page screenshots without activating
  controlled tabs; full-page capture at fractional DPI and with overlay scrollbars.
- Bounded renderer and frame reads, preserving usable observations when optional
  layout reads time out and preventing overlapping reads after a timeout.
- Keep page actions visible beside nonmodal sidebars and honor accessibility modality.
- Prevent control overlays from swallowing clicks and clear stale overlays when
  observed tabs are released.
- Accept lowercase special keys, match ARIA loading states case-insensitively,
  return visible option labels from selection, and retain same-URL reloads in recordings.
- Deliver navigation timeout results before transport expiry and bound human-help cleanup.
- Enforce remote device capacity across pending connections and preserve active
  sessions while renaming browser instances.
- DSH Plugin: settle commands when child processes exit without closing their
  streams, bound cancellation and output draining, and preserve completed results.
- DSH Plugin: restore lazy tool registration after plugin reloads and resumed
  conversations without repeatedly scanning streaming history.
- DSH Plugin: render screenshot cards independently of host attachment UI components,
  preserve previews across host rerenders, and keep extreme-aspect-ratio thumbnails usable.
- Preserve managed skill source links and handle CRLF metadata and incomplete installations.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- [Remote browser connections](docs/remote-extension-connection.md) with a built-in
  server, one-use pairing links, device credential renewal and revocation, and
  support for native TLS or a TLS reverse proxy. Remote upload and download are unsupported.
- [Operation audit](docs/operation-audit.md): opt-in task history stored on the
  daemon host, with redacted operation metadata, export, deletion and 30-day retention
- [Full-page screenshots](docs/long-screenshot.md) from extension Quick Actions and
  the CLI, with streamed PNG output, cancellation and lazy-loaded page capture
- Canvas visual refs, on-demand element screenshots and screenshot-bound point
  clicks; observation cursor continuation when an explicit token limit is used
- [Scroll-to element primitive](docs/scroll-to.md) across CLI, Extension and DSH Plugin,
  with ancestor-clipped visible bounds, iframe support and cooperative cancellation
- Native [mouse-wheel input](docs/wheel.md), explicit focus and blur actions
- [Host-managed daemon setup](docs/sandboxed-agents.md) with `BSK_HOME` and
  `BSK_AUTO_START=0` for agents whose command sandboxes reap background processes
- Configurable local connection port in the extension popup and Korean localization

### Changed

- **Automation settings:** the extension's saved borrow-confirmation and human-help
  switches govern existing and new sessions. `--unattended`, `tab borrow --no-confirm`
  and `BSK_REQUEST_HELP=off` are deprecated compatibility inputs and cannot override
  these switches. Set the browser preferences when upgrading unattended workflows.
- Managed CLI skills update only while their content matches the installed baseline;
  custom instructions and local edits are preserved, with recovery guidance in `doctor`
- DSH Plugin: use the native browser sidebar when available, with a floating-panel fallback

### Fixed

- Windows installer path handling, verification of the resolved executable, and
  replacement of installations using a daemon from another directory
- Browser connection preference recovery and compatibility during staggered component upgrades
- Observation document and frame geometry consistency, Canvas target identity checks,
  and screenshot/session cleanup during cancellation or navigation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- DSH Plugin: clarified installation, configuration, profile restart, and upgrade instructions

### Fixed
- CLI: reliable Windows self-updates, including executable replacement and daemon restart
- CLI: Windows named-pipe connection continuity and stale daemon process detection
- Windows installer: PowerShell 5.1 compatibility, path quoting, and staged executable replacement
- CLI / DSH Plugin: cancellation propagation and upload/download cleanup when the parent process exits
- Extension: tab ownership and session cleanup when agent tabs fail to open or borrowed tabs are returned or closed
- Extension: navigation recovery when other extensions restrict Chrome DevTools Protocol access
- Extension: background input filling, automatic append behavior, and verification of field values before reporting success
- Extension: match observed form state to the correct element after page changes
- Extension: UUID generation fallback for recording and overlays on insecure origins
- Browser locale matching for regional language variants
- DSH Plugin: observation state synchronization, thumbnail capture lifecycle, and stale preview cleanup
- DSH Plugin: removed the obsolete client runtime host dependency

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- File transfer: upload and download support across CLI, Extension, and DSH Plugin
- File transfer: drag-and-drop upload (`drop-to-upload`)
- VOM semantic graph, name enrichment, and hover perception modules
- VOM hover probing (opt-in via `observe` parameter)
- DSH Plugin: browser tool parity with CLI commands
- Edge Add-ons automated publishing in CI
- Protocol upgrade reminder when CLI / Extension protocol versions differ
- Browser evaluation harness (`evals/browser/`)
- Unified release script (`scripts/release.mjs`)

### Changed

- VOM rendering algorithm optimizations
- Leaner SKILL.md agent instructions
- DSH Plugin: simplified browser commands
- Borrow confirmation UX — proactive focus and longer timeout
- PiP window now has a close button

### Fixed
- Screenshot media type detection (was hard-coded to `image/png`)
- DSH Plugin session lifecycle stability
- DSH Plugin Cordis package ID mismatch
- Observation thumbnail media type sniffing
- Upload/download race conditions and layout bypass issues
- VOM repeated name and safety policy issues
