//! Per-rpc-id state machine for `tool.*` RPCs that the daemon is
//! tracking on behalf of an IPC caller.
//!
//! Every business `tool.*` RPC the IPC handler accepts gets one entry
//! here, registered *before* the per-session queue takes over. Entries
//! cover the full lifetime of an in-flight tool call:
//!
//! 1. **Queued** — registered in the IPC handler immediately on
//!    request arrival; `browser_id` and `ws_rpc_id` are `None` because
//!    the per-session worker has not yet dequeued the job.
//! 2. **Forwarded** — the worker has resolved the owning browser and
//!    allocated a WS-side correlation id, and is now awaiting the
//!    extension's response.
//! 3. **Done** — the IPC response has been written; the
//!    [`InflightGuard`] returned at registration drops, removing the
//!    entry.
//!
//! Each entry owns a shared [`AbortToken`] so cancellation is uniform
//! across both phases (review C2):
//!
//! * `handle_cancel` trips the token on a queued entry → the worker's
//!   pre-flight observes it and short-circuits with `cancelled` before
//!   any WS frame leaves the daemon.
//! * `handle_cancel` trips the token on a forwarded entry → the
//!   worker's `tokio::select!` returns `cancelled` immediately, AND
//!   `handle_cancel` separately pushes a WS-side `cancel { rpc_id }`
//!   frame so the extension's dispatcher can abort its
//!   `AbortController`.
//!
//! Daemon-local cancellable runners (`tool.wait_ms`) keep their own
//! [`super::abort::AbortRegistry`] — the cancel handler tries the
//! local registry first and only falls through to this WS-forwarding
//! layer when no local token answers.
