/**
 * Optional UI request channel for authenticated remote gateways.
 *
 * A gateway that runs tasks for a user usually renders its own view of the
 * running task: a small preview of the page the agent is working on, and a
 * control that brings that tab to the front. Both have to answer while the
 * session's tool queue is busy — during a long navigation, or while
 * `request_help` waits for the user — which is exactly when the ordinary tool
 * RPCs cannot run, because they are serialized per session.
 *
 * These requests are therefore answered here and never enter the tool
 * dispatcher. Attach this to the socket before `WSTransport` so a `ui.*` frame
 * is consumed by this listener instead of being reported as an unknown method.
 * Only authenticated remote sockets carry the channel; a local daemon socket
 * keeps the native protocol unchanged.
